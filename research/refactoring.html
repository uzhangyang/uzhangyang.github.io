<h1>FineLock: Automatically Refactoring Coarse-grained Locks into Fine-grained Locks</h1>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align:justify">Lock is frequently used to guarantee the correctness of shared resources access in concurrent programs. Unfortunately, concurrent programs based on locks are susceptible to lock contention which would result in low performance and poor scalability. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Inappropriate granularity of a lock makes lock contention even worse. It is generally accepted that employing a coarse-grained lock may exacerbate lock contention while a fine-grained lock may mitigate lock contention by decreasing the waiting time of other threads that attempt to acquire the lock. Consequently, there is a strong need to employ fine-grained lock. However, writing a program based on fine-grained lock is much more difficult compared with that based on a coarse-grained lock, which requires careful design and expertise. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We propose a solution for converting a coarse-grained synchronized lock into a fine-grained <i>ReentrantReadWriteLock</i> lock and develop a prototype named FineLock. It can refactor locks into downgrading lock and splitting lock, which is not well supported in existing tools.</p>
<h2>Fine-Grained Lock Patterns</h2>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align:justify">FineLock transforms a  coarse-grained synchronized lock into a fine-grained <i>ReentrantReadWriteLock</i> by lock downgrading and lock splitting.</p>
<h3>Lock Downgrading</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">We showcase how FineLock can reduce lock contention using the following example:</p>
<pre>
1 <code>public</code> <code>synchronized</code> void cached() {
2     <code>if</code> (!cacheValid) {
3         ... <comment>// write into cache</comment>
4     }
5     ... <comment>// read data</comment>
6 }       </pre>

<p style="text-align:justify">The code shows a typical implementation of cache processing where the method is protected by a synchronized lock (line 1). It first checks whether the cache contains data in line 2. If so, the data is read (line 5). Otherwise, data will be written into the cache (line 3). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">This figure shows the code refactored by lock downgrading:</p>

<pre>
11 <code>public</code> void cached() {
12     lock.readLock().lock();
13     <code>if</code> (!cacheValid) {
14         lock.readLock().unlock();
15         lock.writeLock().lock();
16         <code>try</code> {
17             <code>if</code> (!cacheValid) {
18	           ... <comment>// write into cache</comment>
19	           lock.readLock().lock();
20             }
21         } <code>finally</code> {
22              lock.writeLock().unlock();
23         }
24      }
25      <code>try</code> {
26           ... <comment>// read data</comment>
27      } <code>finally</code> {
28           lock.readLock().unlock();
29      }
30  }    </pre>

<p style="text-align:justify">It first acquires a read lock (line 12) which is enough to ensure concurrency for the condition checking in line 13. When the condition holds, a write lock must be used and thus the read lock is released (line 14) and a write lock is acquired (line 15). Note that the condition is rechecked in line 17 to guarantee the consistency since the condition might be changed by another thread. After the data is written to the cache (line 18), the write lock is downgraded into a read lock (line 22) to allow more concurrency. Finally, after the data is read (line 26), the read lock is released in line 28.</p>

<h3>Lock Splitting</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">The example code is as follow. The method <i>checkTowrite()</i> is protected by a synchronized lock. It first checks the flag in line 32. If the conditions holds, the write operations are executed (line 33). </p>
<pre>
31 <code>public</code> <code>synchronized</code> void checkToWrite(){
32     <code>if</code> (flag) {
33         ... <comment>// write operations</comment>
34     }
35 }</pre>

<p style="text-align:justify">This figure shows the code refactored by lock splitting:</p>
<pre>
36 <code>public</code> void checkToWrite(){
37     lock.readLock.lock();
38     <code>try</code> {
39         <code>if</code> (flag) {
40             lock.readLock.unlock();
41             lock.writeLock.lock();
42	       <code>if</code> (flag) {
43                 ... <comment>// write operations </comment>
44             }
45         }
46      } <code>finally</code> {
47           <code>if</code> (lock.isWriteLockedByCurrentThread()) {
48	         lock.writeLock.unlock();
49	     } <code>else</code> {
50	         lock.readLock.unlock();
51	     }
52      }
53 } </pre>
<p style="text-align:justify">The refactored code first acquires a read lock (line 37) for the condition checking. When the condition holds, a write lock should be used.  A read lock is released (line 40) and a write lock is acquired (line 41). The condition needs to be rechecked (line 42). The finally block is used to determine which lock the thread holds and release it (line 47-51).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The following figure shows another pattern of lock splitting. The read and write operations are separated in methods <i>WriteRead()</i> and <i>ReadWrite()</i>. The read lock can be acquired for the read operations (lines 67-72, 81-86), and the write lock can be acquired for the write operations (lines 61-66, 87-92).</p>
<pre>
60 <code>public</code> void WriteRead(){
61     lock.writelock.lock();
62     <code>try</code> {
63          ... <comment>// write operations</comment>
64     } <code>finally</code> {
65	    lock.writelock.unlock();
66     }
67     lock.readlock.lock();
68     <code>try</code> {
69          ... <comment>// read operations</comment>
70     } <code>finally</code> {
71          lock.readlock.unlock();
72     }
73 }
   ...
80 <code>public</code> void ReadWrite (){
81     lock.readlock.lock();
82     <code>try</code> {
83          ... <comment>// read operations</comment>
84     } <code>finally</code> {
85          lock.readlock.unlock();
86     }
87     lock.writelock.lock();
88     <code>try</code> {
89          ... <comment>// write operations</comment>
90     } <code>finally</code> {
91          lock.writelock.unlock();
92     }
93 }    </pre>
